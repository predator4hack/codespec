### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Days 1-3)

#### 1.1 Project Setup

-   [ ] Initialize VS Code extension project
-   [ ] Configure TypeScript and Webpack
-   [ ] Set up basic package.json with required contributions
-   [ ] Create directory structure

#### 1.2 Basic Extension Activation

```typescript
// src/extension.ts
export function activate(context: vscode.ExtensionContext) {
    // Register tree data provider
    // Register commands
    // Initialize services
}
```

#### 1.3 Sidebar Integration

-   [ ] Create `FeatureTreeProvider` class
-   [ ] Register tree view in package.json
-   [ ] Implement basic tree view with dummy data
-   [ ] Add sidebar icon and view container

## Clarifying Questions for Task 1 Implementation

Before I start implementing Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure), I have a few
questions to ensure we're building exactly what you need:

1. VS Code Extension Target Version: Should we target the minimum supported VS
   Code version from the README (1.74.0) or a more recent version? This affects
   which APIs we can use.
   Decide based on your knowledge. I have not much clue about this. You can go with the recent version but make sure that it can be installed by people who haven't updated their vs code for an year or something

2. Package Manager Preference: The README mentions npm, but would you prefer
   to use npm, yarn, or pnpm for this project?
   yes, use npm

3. TypeScript Configuration: Do you have any specific TypeScript compiler
   preferences (strict mode, target ES version, etc.) or should I use the
   standard VS Code extension defaults?
   Use standard vs code extension defaults

4. Directory Structure: I see the planned structure in the README, but should
   I create all the directories upfront or only create them as needed during
   implementation?
   Create as needed

5. Testing Framework: The README mentions @vscode/test-electron - do you want
   me to set up the testing infrastructure as part of the basic project setup, or
   should we focus on core functionality first?
   first, lets focus on the core functionality

6. CLI Agent Priority: Should the extension work without any CLI agents
   installed (graceful degradation), or should it require at least one CLI agent
   to be functional?
   For now, lets focus on the CLI agents. user should have at leas one

7. Development Workflow: Do you want hot reload/watch mode configured for
   development, or just basic build setup?
   yes, configure for reload/watch mode

## Detailed Implementation Plan for Phase 1

Based on the answers provided, here's the step-by-step implementation plan for Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure):

### Implementation Environment

-   **VS Code Target**: 1.74.0 (supports users with VS Code versions up to 1 year old)
-   **Package Manager**: npm
-   **TypeScript**: Standard VS Code extension defaults
-   **Directory Strategy**: Create as needed during implementation
-   **Focus**: Core functionality first (no testing setup in Phase 1)
-   **CLI Requirement**: At least one CLI agent must be available
-   **Development**: Hot reload/watch mode enabled

### Step-by-Step Implementation Tasks

#### Task 1.1: Initialize Base Project Structure

```bash
# Commands to run:
npm init -y
npm install --save-dev @types/vscode@^1.74.0 @types/node@16.x typescript@^4.9.4
npm install --save-dev webpack@^5.75.0 webpack-cli@^5.0.1 ts-loader@^9.4.1
```

**Files to create:**

-   `package.json` - Extension manifest with proper VS Code contributions
-   `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for VS Code extensions
-   `webpack.config.js` - Build configuration with watch mode
-   `.vscode/launch.json` - Debug configuration for extension development
-   `.vscode/tasks.json` - Build tasks for VS Code
-   `.vscodeignore` - Files to exclude from extension package

#### Task 1.2: Core Extension Structure

**Files to create:**

-   `src/extension.ts` - Main extension entry point with activation/deactivation
-   `src/providers/featureTreeProvider.ts` - Tree view data provider for sidebar
-   `src/models/featureSpec.ts` - Basic data models for feature specifications

#### Task 1.3: Package.json Configuration

**Configure the following sections:**

-   `engines.vscode`: "^1.74.0"
-   `activationEvents`: ["onView:featureSpecs"]
-   `main`: "./dist/extension.js"
-   `contributes.views`: Register the feature specs tree view
-   `contributes.commands`: Basic commands (create, refresh)
-   `contributes.menus`: Context menus for tree items
-   `scripts`: compile, watch, package commands

#### Task 1.4: Basic Sidebar Implementation

**Implementation details:**

-   Create `FeatureTreeProvider` class implementing `vscode.TreeDataProvider`
-   Register tree view in `activate()` function
-   Implement dummy data structure for initial testing
-   Add proper tree item types and icons
-   Configure tree view refresh functionality

#### Task 1.5: Development Workflow Setup

**Configure:**

-   Webpack watch mode for automatic compilation
-   VS Code debug configuration for F5 testing
-   Source maps for debugging
-   Hot reload support during development

### Expected File Structure After Phase 1

```
feature-spec-extension/
├── package.json                    # ✓ Extension manifest
├── tsconfig.json                   # ✓ TypeScript config
├── webpack.config.js               # ✓ Build config
├── .vscode/
│   ├── launch.json                 # ✓ Debug config
│   └── tasks.json                  # ✓ Build tasks
├── .vscodeignore                   # ✓ Package exclusions
├── src/
│   ├── extension.ts                # ✓ Main entry point
│   ├── providers/
│   │   └── featureTreeProvider.ts  # ✓ Tree data provider
│   └── models/
│       └── featureSpec.ts          # ✓ Data models
└── dist/                           # Generated build output
```

### Success Criteria for Phase 1

1. **Extension loads successfully** in VS Code development host
2. **Sidebar appears** in Explorer view with "Feature Specs" title
3. **Dummy tree items** are visible and expandable
4. **Right-click context menu** shows available commands
5. **Hot reload works** - changes to source files trigger rebuild
6. **No console errors** during extension activation
7. **Extension can be packaged** without build errors

### Implementation Order

1. **Setup package.json and dependencies** (Task 1.1)
2. **Configure build system** (webpack, tsconfig)
3. **Create basic extension.ts** with activation
4. **Implement FeatureTreeProvider** with dummy data
5. **Configure VS Code contributions** (views, commands, menus)
6. **Test and verify** all functionality works
7. **Setup development workflow** (debug config, watch mode)

### Key Implementation Notes

-   Use `vscode.TreeItem` and `vscode.TreeDataProvider` for sidebar
-   Implement proper error handling for missing dependencies
-   Follow VS Code extension naming conventions
-   Use built-in VS Code icons for consistency
-   Ensure extension activates only when needed
-   Configure proper TypeScript paths and module resolution
-   Set up source maps for debugging capabilities

### Dependencies for Next Phase

After Phase 1 completion, the foundation will be ready for:

-   File system operations (.features directory)
-   CLI agent detection and integration
-   Template management system
-   Advanced tree view features (file-based items)

This implementation plan provides complete context for any developer to pick up and implement Phase 1 systematically.
